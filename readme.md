# Tindog üê∂ü¶¥

This is a Tinder app for dogs. Although it might sound silly, it was part of the solo project of module 7 Advanced Javascript on Scrimba. It was a great opportunity to learn as well as to put into practice everything learned so far, such as classes, map(), fill(), join(), Array constructor, Object destructuring, Constructor Functions, object.assign, reduce() and much more.

## üíª Reflection


- This project has been built with the purpose of putting into practice everything learned so far from the Scrimba JavaScript course. It's so rewarding and encouraging to see my improvement throughout the weeks. I've spent 2 days finishing this off, spending the majority of the time working on understanding better how classes, Array constructor, setTimeOut work. 


- I wanted to create a project where I could put into practice all the hight order functions in JavaScript and it was great to see the final result. It was great to build muscle memory as well as to create something of my own.


- The biggest challenge was to know the exact moment to call each function, making sure the app wouldn't crash or that you wouldn't be able to press any button whilst a new profile is being loaded.


- Skills learned:classes, map(), fill(), join(), Array constructor, Object destructuring, Constructor Functions, object.assign, reduce(), setTimeOut().
